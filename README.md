This repository contains a collection of projects developed in C++ using the OpenCV library for image and video processing. Each project addresses different aspects and functionalities of the OpenCV library.

## Projects

1. **Alter Colors**
   - **Description:** This project allows dynamically altering the colors of an image, providing an easy and efficient way to experiment with different color schemes.

2. **Capture Video**
   - **Description:** Capture Video is an application that utilizes the OpenCV API to capture video from an external source, such as a camera connected to the system, enabling real-time processing or recording for later use.

3. **License Plate Detection**
   - **Description:** This project aims at automatic detection of vehicle license plates in images or videos using advanced image processing algorithms, making it useful for surveillance and security applications.

4. **Colors Detection**
   - **Description:** Colors Detection is an application that uses computer vision techniques to detect specific colors in an image, enabling precise identification and segmentation of objects based on their colors.

5. **Detection Forms**
   - **Description:** Detection Forms is a project focused on detecting and recognizing geometric shapes in images, providing a solid foundation for image analysis and computer vision applications.

6. **Detection Faces**
   - **Description:** Detection Faces is a powerful application that utilizes facial recognition algorithms to detect and recognize faces in images or videos, opening up possibilities for a wide range of applications, such as security and entertainment.

7. **Dimensions and Cut Images**
   - **Description:** This project allows obtaining precise dimensions of objects in images and performing cuts based on these dimensions, providing a useful tool for image processing and data analysis applications.

8. **Forms**
   - **Description:** Forms is an application that offers advanced functionalities for manipulation and processing of geometric shapes in images, including operations like rotation, scaling, and perspective transformations.

9. **Lena - Example**
   - **Description:** Lena - Example is a simple project demonstrating the use of the famous "Lena" image as an example input for image processing algorithms, widely used in the computer vision community.

10. **Perspective**
    - **Description:** Perspective is a project that explores advanced techniques for perspective manipulation in images, allowing distortion corrections and transformations that can be useful in a variety of applications, such as photography and cartography.

11. **Street Plates**
    - **Description:** Street Plates is an application specialized in the detection and recognition of street plates in images or videos captured in urban environments, providing a robust solution for traffic monitoring systems and road safety.

12. **Text Image**
    - **Description:** Text Image is a tool developed for text manipulation in images, allowing extraction, recognition, and editing of text in various applications, such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and document processing.

13. **Testing WebCam with OpenCV**
    - **Description:** Testing WebCam with OpenCV is a simple project to test the functionality of the webcam using the OpenCV library, providing a quick and easy way to verify if the camera is working correctly on the system.

## Requirements
